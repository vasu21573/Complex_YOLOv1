# Complex_YOLOv1
Undergraduate research to assess the performance of complex-valued neural networks in object detection when compared to traditional neural networks. Leveraging the YOLOv1 architecture as the baseline for object detection, the study involves developing and implementing
complex-valued neural network models.
